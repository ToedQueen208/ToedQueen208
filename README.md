# About me

Im a nerdy aspiring software developer who loves to code.
I love using technology to help people and make the world more accessable for example my project I did on using Virtual Reality to help people with Claustrophobia.

There are also some **whimsical projects** such as DungeDex, which turns Pokemon into a customisable DnD monster 

Feel free to browse my projects ðŸ˜„
